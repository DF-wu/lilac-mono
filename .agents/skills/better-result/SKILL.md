# Better Result

Use the installed `better-result` public API and Lilac's local architecture policy. Do not introduce a
wrapper or rely on remembered signatures.

## Establish The Contract

1. Read the nearest Result-returning code, its callers, and its final handling boundary.
2. Inspect the installed `better-result` declarations when a signature or inferred union is uncertain.
3. Classify each failure as an expected caller decision, an external exception to translate once, or a
   defect represented by `Panic`.

The contract is established when every expected error reaches an explicit policy boundary and defects
remain defects.

## Choose The Syntax

- Use `Result.ok` and `Result.err` to construct a Result. Use domain-owned `TaggedError` variants when
  callers need to distinguish failures.
- Use `map` for a pure success transformation and `mapError` for error translation. A callback returning a
  Result belongs in `andThen`, not `map`.
- Use `andThen` for one Result-returning continuation. Use `tryRecover` only when the error branch can
  recover to another Result; do not use it as error mapping.
- Use `Result.gen` with `yield*` for linear control flow with multiple fallible steps, intermediate values,
  or Result-based guard clauses. End the generator with `Result.ok(value)`.
- In an async `Result.gen`, write `yield* Result.await(operation())` for `Promise<Result<T, E>>`. Do not
  write `yield* await operation()`.
- For a short async continuation, use `andThenAsync` with a named async Result-returning function. Lilac's
  syntax gate rejects inline async Result callbacks.
- Use `Result.all` when every operation must succeed and `Result.partition` when all successes and errors
  must be retained. Use their async variants only with promises that resolve to Results.
- Use object-form `Result.try` or `Result.tryPromise` at an external exception boundary. Its catch function
  must be total: return a closed captured value and never throw, reject, or signal a host. Classify or
  re-signal retained defects only after leaving protected Better Result callbacks. A positive `isErr()`
  `if` guard may settle the immutable local returned directly by that capture; keep the guard and capture in
  the same lexical block and do not alias or transform the Result first. Forward cancellation signals when
  the operation supports them.
- Use `match` when leaving the Result abstraction at the final policy or host boundary. Exhaustively match
  tagged error unions there rather than spreading error policy through the workflow.
- Use `Result.codec` with boundary-owned schemas for persisted, wire, or independently versioned Result
  data.

## Preserve Local Boundaries

Lilac is stricter than upstream examples: except for the narrow direct-capture `isErr()` settlement above,
production code composes Results declaratively rather than reading branch discriminants, calling Result
guards, or extracting with `unwrap`. Follow diagnostics from `scripts/architecture` and read
`scripts/architecture/README.md` before changing a registered boundary.

Better Result protects combinator and `match` callbacks by wrapping thrown values in a new `Panic`.
Existing thunked `match` handlers can intentionally execute host signals, SQLite operations, or retained
Panics outside that protection. Do not simplify one without proving exception identity, cleanup ordering,
and transaction behavior with focused tests.

Production `TryStatement` syntax is forbidden. Use `using` or `await using` only when lexical ownership and
`SuppressedError` precedence match the required policy. When cleanup can fail or an original Panic must win,
capture operation and cleanup outcomes separately and settle their precedence outside protected callbacks.

When API details are still unclear, read the smallest relevant page indexed by
`https://better-result.dev/agents.txt` rather than loading the full documentation corpus.

## Verify

Run the focused workspace test and typecheck, then `bun run lint:architecture` for production Result
changes. The change is complete when inferred success and error unions are preserved and every applicable
check passes.
